# config files

This is not meant as a clonable DIRECTORY, but as a collection of my configuration / development environment files. 
These files are at several different locations within my setup.

## Goals:

* Initialize new projects with an instant GitHub repo, including:
** MIT license generation,
** stack-specific scaffolding.

* Well-established global `.gitignore`.
