# Personal Environment for Software Development

This is not meant as a clonable directory, but as a collection of stuff I use for my personal configuration setup, including dotfiles.

## Goals:

* Initialize new projects with an instant GitHub repo, including:
	* MIT license generation,
	* stack-specific scaffolding.
* Well-established global `.gitignore`.

## Chrome extensions

* Wistia Video Downloader
* Earth View from Google Earth
* Go To Playing Tab
