# personal config files (or "dotfiles", and more)

This is not meant as a clonable DIRECTORY, but as a collection of stuff I use for my personal configuration setup, including dotfiles.


## Goals:

* Initialize new projects with an instant GitHub repo, including:
	* MIT license generation,
	* stack-specific scaffolding.

* Well-established global `.gitignore`.
